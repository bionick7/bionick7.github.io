    <h1> UZTAFOX </h1>
    <p> UZLAPFOX is the official language of KROMZZAKA SSUZOΠKUXA. 
    It was introduced shortly after it's founding to further national identity and facilitate communication 
    between citizen of different backgrounds as well as further isolating the population from 
    foreign influence. The stated goals of UPAPFOX is to be simple and easy to learn in 
    nature while still being able to support technical language and jargon of various types 
    as well as common/casual language. This was done by having a small inventory of atomic, short words that 
    can build up to more complex concepts. </p>
    
    <div class="text-4040">

    <h2> Phonetic Inventory </h2>
    <p> Phonetic Inventory and Spelling The language tries to maintain a 
    1 to 1 relationship with characters and intended pronunciation and no capitalization. In practice, 
    especially vocal pronunciation strongly varies across dialect A even has two pronunciations canonically. 
    A pronunciation table is found below  </p>
    <div style="column-count: 4;">
      "I" -> /i/ <br>
      "U" -> /u/ <br>
      "A" -> /a/ or /ɑ/ <br>
      "O" -> /o/ <br>
      "P" -> /p/ <br>
      "B" -> /b/ <br>
      "T" -> /t/ <br>
      "D" -> /d/ <br>
      "K" -> /k/ <br>
      "G" -> /g/ <br>
      "M" -> /m/ <br>
      "N" -> /n/ <br>
      "R" -> /r/ <br>
      "F" -> /f/ <br>
      "S" -> /s/ <br>
      "Z" -> /ʃ/ <br>
      "X" -> /ʀ̥/ <br>
      "H" -> /h/ <br>
      "Γ" -> /ɹ/ <br>
      "L" -> /l/ <br>
      "Π" -> /ŋ/ <br>
      "SS" -> /ts/ <br>
      "ZZ" -> /tʃ/ <br>
      "II" -> /iɯi/ <br>
      "UU" -> /uɯu/ <br>
      "AA" -> /aɂa/ <br>
    </div>
    <p> The letters are mostly capitalized latin letters with 2 exceptions from the cyrillic or 
    greek alphabet. Double letters (SS, ZZ, II, UU, AA) often get their own symbol with one or 
    more lines drawn as a double line, similarly to how sets of numbers (like ℝ) are written. 
    For latinization, Γ and Π can be written with the lower case letters r and g respectively. 
    Arabic numerals are used for digits, and mathematical notation remains mostly unchanged. 
    Grammar Pronouns MA, TA and XA are singular pronouns in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person 
    (I, you, he/she/it). plural pronouns are composed depending on which people are involved.
    e.g. TAXA is involving the one or more people 2nd person and one or more people 3rd person 
    (you as in you people and these other people or you and that other guy) TAA and XAA refer 
    to a group of multiple people in the 2nd person and multiple people in the 3rd person respectively. 
    XAA is used as the indefinite pronoun ("one can ...") Case The case of a word is indicated 
    by a prefix or lack thereof. The table below indicates usecases and the closes case in latin
    for comparison. Note that cases can rarely be translated one-to-one. </p>
    <p>
      -- 	Subject 	Nominative <br>
      A- 	Object 	Accusative <br>
      AA..- 	Further objects 	Accusative <br>
      I- 	Relation or possession to (following word) 	Genitive <br>
      TA- 	Place 	Locative <br>
      ΓA- 	With help of/by means 	Ablative <br>
    </p>
    
    <h2> Tense </h2>
    <p>
      Tense is indicated by keywords placed anywhere in the sentence. (Leading Tense keywords can place emphasis on the tense). 
      These are FATO for future tenses, UFATO for prior tenses and XOKO for the current one. These keywords 
      can be stacked to describe events that took place in relation to other events (e.g. UFATUFATFATO KOΓI -> I 
      had been planning to go later). If the tense keyword is omitted, the tense of the previous sentence or sub 
      sentence is implied, or XOKU if it is the first sentence.  
    </p>
    <h2> Special Verbs </h2>
      ASI is a special verb to use to associate a subject with a verb (MA ASI XOKZAKU -> I am bored). 
      In informal language, ASI (and sometimes the subject) often gets omitted. ASI and UASI (the negation of ASI) 
      can be used as yes and no.
    <h2> Word Composition </h2>
    UZLAPFOX has a relatively small number of root words that can be chained together to form different concepts. 
    The suffix of a word then indicates it's role.
    <p>

      -A -> noun <br>
      -I -> verb <br>
      -U -> adjective <br>
      -O -> adverb <br>

    </p>
    In addition U- as a prefix indicates a negation <br>
    A word structure could be U - root - root - (U - root) - A  
    <h2> Examples </h2>
    <p>
      UMILZAKA (Sadness) -> U - MIL - ZAK - A (not - nice - feeling - [Noun]) <br>
      SMIΠKOKMAΠU (Green) -> SMIΠ - KOK - MAΠ - U (life - matter - color - [Adjective]) <br>
      KUZZKOΓFOTA (Aluminium) -> KUZZ - KOΓ - FOT (sky - travel - metal - [Noun]) or (aircraft - metal) <br>
      UUMINA (Infinity) -> U - U - MIN - A (not - not - number - [Noun]) or rather (anti - zero)   <br>
    </p>
    <h2> Numbers </h2>
    <p>
      MIN- is the number/count root word, so numbers themselves end in -MINA while a count is ended in -MINO. Zero is UMINA (not - amount). Further numbers get written in decimal notation like so:
      digit - order - digit - order - digit - order
      where a digit is one of MO, TO, XO, PO, ZO, DO, KO, GO, NO from 1 to 9 and is omitted for 0.
      orders are of type OK, OOK, MIL for 10, 100 and 1000. the order is omitted for 1 and takes form of 
      MI - n - L for higher orders where n is the amount of orders above 1000. See table for examples
      
    </p>
    <p>
      ...TIK...MINO indicates fractions
      ...TUZ...MINO - indicates a decimal seperator
      The UA- prefix indicates negative numbers.
