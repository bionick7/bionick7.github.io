        The P/C-69 ship core first entered service in 1971. Despite being a first generation
        core, it proved very successful and was retrofitted numerous times. It's powerful
        reactor, generous crew compartment and vast compatibility with all kinds of engines
        and payloads meant it could be used for all kinds of combat, patrol and even civilian
        applications by numerous clients. The later version (P/C-69 U2) changed internal
        structure to make more efficient use of internal space and replaced the reactor with
        a slightly weaker, but more efficient one, as well as modernizing the armor
        composition. Both versions severely suffer from travel range, making them widely
        unsuited to engage in offensive combat, unless fitted with external drop-tanks. The
        early nuclear reactor was also very maintenance heavy and unreliable, requiring
        frequent maintenance and constant proximity to port or a mothership. P/C-69 s can
        still be seen used today for search and rescue, specialized utility vehicles and by
        some paramilitary organizations.

      <h2> Famous example </h2>
      <p>
        The Space Hamster depicted here was a missile
        corvette used by the Lunar navy as part of a larger
        battle group in the early 2000's to defend stations on
        the L2 Earth-Sun Lagrange point. It was most notable
        in the 2011 John Carver Mutiny, were the crew of 8
        displayed great skills in disabling a small carrier and
        other corvette as well as surviving in a badly
        damaged and decompressed ship for a week until
        saved. The ship is now on display as a museum ship
        around Luna.
