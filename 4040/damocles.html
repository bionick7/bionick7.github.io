        With growing wealth and autonomy, the cis-jovian state found itself with outdated and disjointed
        naval defenses and little to no offensive capability. This eventually lead to the development of the
        'Damocles Sword' and her sister-ship, the 'Inevitable arrival'. The Damocles Sword class was based 
        on the martian navies tactical artillery and expanded to fit the role of  a dedicated flagship. The 
        general idea was to have a mobile high-Dv, high firepower flagship to bolster older defenses 
        wherever a battle was expected. The development of the ship was  long and troubled as a lot of 
        habitation and power management systems had to be reworked, in addition to adding the state
        -of-the-art electronic warfare and sensor capabilities and the insistence of the cis-jovian insistence 
        to produce everything locally. In addition to it's traditional role, the quick response time, together 
        with it's powerful reactor, diverse accommodations, large lazaret and overdesigned agricultural 
        arrays lends this ship well to humanitarian operations.

      <h2> High-tech pride </h2>
      <p>
        The Communication & intel Acquisition & Processing device (CIAP) is the pride of 
        Lagrange labs and a milestone for jovian technological achievements.
        The device can monitor most major traffic in the jovian system passively while 
        hidden and in radio silence and respond to an oncoming attack after 
        the attacker already committed to the trajectory.When on the 
        offensive, the dish can be used to communicate 
        with almost anything anywhere in the 
        jovian (political) sphere of 
        influence

      <h2> Designed for kinetic penetration </h2>
      <p>
        The defining feature of the tactical artillery that the ship is based on was 
        the large, GJ spinal rail gun the rest of the ship is build around. In combat, 
        the reactor is able to peak at 2 GW to fire the spinal gun 2x per second, 
        making full use of the massive high-power sails that define the silhouette
